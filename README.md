## This game is WIP!

Please do not have high expectations! Unfortunately, this year I had significantly less time to spend on development, so the game is not currently in a completed state. Many gameplay mechanics are missing, the story is unorganized, and no sounds or music are present. I hope that you might find at least some enjoyment playing it though!
