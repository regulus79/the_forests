# The Forests

Regulus' Submission to the 2025 Luanti Game Jam

## This game is very unfinished!

Please do not have high expectations! Unfortunately, this year I had significantly less time to spend on development. The game is not at all in a completed state. Many gameplay mechanics are missing, the story is unorganized, and no sounds or music are present. But I do hope you may find at least some enjoyment from whatever little gameplay is present.
